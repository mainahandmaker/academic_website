title: Investigating Whimbrel use of a critical nocturnal roost
subtitle: Using GPS transmitters to better understand foraging and roosting habitat selection during migratory stopover

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: We are deploying GPS transmitters on Whimbrel to track their daily movements to and from a critical nocturnal roost and diurnal foraging areas, to better understand the role nocturnal roosts play in this species' stopover ecology.

## Overview

Together with collaborators [**Felicia Sanders**](https://www.dnr.sc.gov/news/2020/oct/oct29-shorebird.php#:~:text=Felicia%20Sanders%2C%20who%20serves%20as,of%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Agencies.), [**Adam Smith**](https://adamdsmith.me/), and my advisor [**Dr. Nathan Senner**](http://www.sennerlab.com/research.html) I am working to better understand how Whimbrel select roosting and foraging habitat during their north and southbound migratory stopovers on the coast of South Carolina.

As of Spring 2021, we have deployed [**Lotek**](http://lotek.com/) solar-powered PinPoint GPS transmitters on 12 individuals. These transmitters record over 100 GPS-quality positions per day and allow data download via antenna base stations we install seasonally at the nocturnal roost site on Deveaux Bank.
