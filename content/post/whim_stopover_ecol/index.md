# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: We are deploying GPS transmitters on Whimbrel to track their daily movements to and from a critical nocturnal roost and diurnal foraging areas, to better understand the role nocturnal roosts play in this species' stopover ecology.

Whimbrel (_Numenius phaeopus_) are experiencing dramatic declines, in part due to the degradation and loss of migratory stopover sites.[^1] The Georgia-South Carolina coast is one of these critical stopover regions, and in fact may be one of only two staging areas used by nearly all Atlantic flyway Whimbrel during northward migration.[^2] For shorebirds like Whimbrel that rely on intertidal habitats, a critical component of high-quality stopover habitat is the availability of safe roost sites that provide a place to rest when feeding areas are inundated by high tide and offer safety from predators and disturbance at night. These nocturnal roost sites may be especially rare,[^3] requiring birds to make long flights to and from their foraging areas each day. For this project, we are tracking the daily movements of Whimbrel that roost on the South Carolina island Deveaux Bank, [the largest known nocturnal roost for the species]({{< ref "publication/waderstudy_2021" >}}).

Together with collaborators [**Felicia Sanders**](https://www.dnr.sc.gov/news/2020/oct/oct29-shorebird.php#:~:text=Felicia%20Sanders%2C%20who%20serves%20as,of%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Agencies.), [**Adam Smith**](https://adamdsmith.me/), and my advisor [**Dr. Nathan Senner**](http://www.sennerlab.com/research.html), I am seeking to better understand how Whimbrel select roosting and foraging habitat during migratory stopover, and investigate what role nocturnal roost sites play in Whimbrel stopover ecology and migratory performance.

As of Spring 2021, we have deployed [**Lotek**](http://lotek.com/) solar-powered PinPoint GPS transmitters on 12 individuals. These transmitters record over 100 GPS-quality positions per day and allow data download via antenna base stations that we install seasonally at the nocturnal roost site on Deveaux Bank.
